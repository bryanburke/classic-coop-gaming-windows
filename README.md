# Classic Co-op Gaming Guides for Windows

This repository contains step-by-step guides for setting up classic games for
online cooperative play in Windows.

Before jumping in, please make note that the guides:

- Only support Microsoft Windows.
- Assume familiarity with the command line and navigating the OS.
- Sometimes use [Scoop](guides/tool_scoop.md) to simplify software installation.
- Provide no help on networking and port forwarding.
- Prefer [GOG Galaxy](guides/tool_gog-galaxy.md) over
  [Steam](guides/tool_steam.md), where possible.
- Prefer Vulkan or DirectX 12 over older DirectX and OpenGL technologies, where
  available.
- Focus solely on co-op play, not singleplayer or deathmatch.
- Are opinionated and always recommend my personal preferences for
  configuration.
