# Tool:GOG Galaxy

GOG Galaxy is the official client for the [GOG.com][] games store.

Where possible, the guides prefer GOG.com and GOG Galaxy over Steam for the
following reasons:

- Games on GOG.com are always DRM-free.
- GOG Galaxy natively supports launching custom executables for games, so game
  time tracking is still possible with third-party engines and launchers.

## Guide

1. Click the **DOWNLOAD GOG GALAXY 2.0** button on the website.
1. Launch the installer and follow its prompts to install the client.
1. If desired, [change the game installation directory][].

   By default, GOG Galaxy installs games to
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games`. Regardless of where you choose to
   install games, the other guides simply refer to the game installation
   directory as `GOG Galaxy\Games`.
